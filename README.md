# Tenant.AI Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a webapp that aims to provide guidance to residents of Massachusetts about any tenancy related concerns they may have. It features a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) full-stack chatbot application** built with **Python, FastAPI, Redis, React and OpenAI's GPT-4o.** The chatbot specializes in answering questions about tenancy rights of the residents of Massachusetts.

The webapp also includes some official resources about tenants laws, rights and help centers that are available to the residents of Massachusetts. 

The chatbot has been heavily inspired by a similar [project](https://github.com/ruizguille/tech-trends-chatbot)

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `backend/`: Contains the Python FastAPI backend code and a local Python version for testing.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code. It uses Vite.js as the build tool and bundler.

## Installation

### Prerequisites âœ…

- Python 3.11+.
- Node.js 18+.
- Poetry (Python package manager).
- Redis Stack Server. Follow the [installation and running instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/). The application requires the RedisJSON and RediSearch modules, which Redis Stack Server includes. Alternatively, you can install Redis and add the required modules yourself.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder and install the Python dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    poetry install
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend folder and set the required environment variable:
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder and install the JavaScript dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. Create a `.env.development` file in the frontend folder and include the required environment variable:
    - `VITE_API_URL`: The URL to connect to the backend API.

## Running the Application

### Loading Source Documents

Make sure Redis Stack Server is running before executing the loading script:

```bash
cd backend
poetry run load
```

This script processes the documents in the `backend/data/docs` directory, creates vector embeddings, and stores them in the Redis database.


### Full-Stack Application

To run the full-stack chatbot application:

1. Ensure Redis Stack Server is running.
   
2. Activate the virtual environment for the backend and start the backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    poetry shell
    fastapi dev app/main.py
    ```

3. In a separate terminal, start the frontend server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
